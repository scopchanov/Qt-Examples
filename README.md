# CuteScope
*Michael Scopchanov's examples of how to use the Qt library*

## What is CuteScope
**CuteScope** is a collection of example desktop applications under Windows, aiming to offer an additional help to the developers, looking for how to implement a particullar feature with Qt

## Why CuteScope?
There is a plenty of information on the Internet of what the Qt library is and how to use it. The Qt documentation iself offers a rich variety of examples in C++ and QML. Even then it is sometimes not so obvious how to implement a particular feature.

## Disclamer
The code in this repository is not on an official release by the Qt company or any other organisation. It is written solely by me, Michael Scopchanov, in my spare time and is based on my personal programming experience and understanding of how the Qt library is intended to be used. Despite my effort to keep my knowledge by:
 
 * Reading the official Qt documentation and examples
 * Watching tutorials availble on Youtube
 * Participating in online events like webinars, Qt related talks, etc.
 * Reading books about generic C++ programming and design patterns
 * Actively participating in Stack Overflow by asking and answering Qt related questions
 * Updating to the latest versions of Qt shortly after their release
 * Digging in the Qt's source code
 * Working on several Qt based projects of mine for desktop applications
 
there is absolutely no guarantee, that the code shared in this repository represents the best, or the only way, to solve a particular programming problem. Please do not use the code blindly, as it is meant only for demonstration purposes, but analyze how it works and when necessary, adapt it to make it fit the requirements and standrads of your particullar application.
