# CuteScope
*Michael Scopchanov's examples of how to use the Qt library*

## What is CuteScope
**CuteScope** is a collection of example desktop applications under Windows, aiming to offer an additional help to the developers, looking for how to implement a particullar feature with Qt.

## Why CuteScope?
There is a plenty of information on the Internet of what the Qt library is and how to use it. The Qt documentation iself offers a rich variety of examples in C++ and QML. Even then it is sometimes not so obvious how to implement a particular feature. 

## How to use CuteScope
To use the examples you need the [Qt Library](https://www.qt.io/) and a C++ compiler for your platform.

1. Download the code
2. Open the `pro`-file of a particular example in Qt Creator
3. Set the kit
4. Build and run the project from Qt Creator

My personal setup is a Windows 10 PC with a Microsoft Visual Studio 2019.

## Disclamer
The code in this repository is **not** an official release by the Qt company or any other organisation. It is written solely by me, Michael Scopchanov, in my spare time and is based on my personal programming experience and understanding of how the Qt library is intended to be used. Despite my effort to keep my knowledge of Qt at a very high level by:
 
 * Reading the official Qt documentation and examples
 * Watching tutorials availble on Youtube
 * Participating in online events like webinars, Qt related talks, etc.
 * Reading books about generic C++ programming and design patterns
 * Actively participating in Stack Overflow by asking and answering Qt related questions
 * Updating to the latest versions of Qt shortly after their release
 * Digging in the Qt's source code
 * Working on several Qt based projects of mine for desktop applications
 
there is absolutely no guarantee, that the code shared in this repository represents the best, or the only way, to solve a particular programming problem. Please do not use the code blindly, as it is meant only for demonstration purposes, but analyze how it works and, when necessary, adapt it to make it fit the requirements and standrads of your particullar application.
